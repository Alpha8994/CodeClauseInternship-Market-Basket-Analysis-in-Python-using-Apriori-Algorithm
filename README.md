Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm
Overview
Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique that focuses on discovering the purchasing patterns of customers. It is widely used in retail and e-commerce to uncover associations between products, helping businesses optimize their product placement, marketing strategies, and cross-selling initiatives.

This project demonstrates the implementation of Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori Algorithm in Python. The Apriori Algorithm is a classic algorithm in association rule learning, which identifies frequent itemsets in a dataset and extracts association rules based on these itemsets.

Apriori Algorithm
The Apriori Algorithm is a crucial component in association rule learning. It follows these key steps:

Frequent Itemset Generation: Identify itemsets (sets of items) that have a support (frequency) above a specified threshold.

Association Rule Generation: Derive association rules from the frequent itemsets. Rules typically consist of an antecedent (premise) and a consequent (result).

Rule Pruning: Remove rules that do not meet a certain confidence threshold.
